# LICENSE

You really need a license?  come on, the whole project is online.  Just know I take no liabilities if your computer crashes with this pretty piece of code, and I don't mind you tearing apart in your computer and publishing it at your own risk.  So long as you don't want to push crap into my repo.  

In case you have pretty good stuff to push into my repo, drop me a line at jomarnavarro@gmail.com
